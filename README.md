# Hanseath

Hanseath is a solution for creating homebrew content files for D&D from the CLI.

Under the hood, Hanseath is dependent on the fantastic work of [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) for formatting the content. If you use and like Hanseath, consider [supporting Homebrewery](https://www.patreon.com/stolksdorf), without which none of this would be possible.
